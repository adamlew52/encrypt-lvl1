# encrypt-lvl1
just a random encryption/decryption software that i've built out of a bunch of random string manipulation techniques


run main.py if you want to use the terminal app. there will be a GUI built soon...

TODO
- GUI
    - same thing as the command line app, just with the ability to click the buttons 
- Processing
    - look in to packaging the project as an exe
